How to write an AgentX based extension to
[Net-SNMP](http://www.net-snmp.org/) in C with CMake as build system.

## Background

It was hard to find any working examples which do not make extensive use
of magic code generators, outdated wiki pages, complicated code not
needed for a simple example, â€¦

## Install

There's no install. You have to compile the source by yourself. This
mini project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for build. You can use all
kinds of CMake GUIs, do what your preferred style is. A simple way to
build on command line, starting in the source directory, would be:


```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

__Note:__ You can change the AgentX master socket to be connected to by
changing the CMake variable `VE_AGENTX_MASTER_SOCKET`, there's no config
file or command line argument for that. (Remember: this is just a simple
example, that would not be focus of this project.)

### Dependencies

You need Net-SNMP library headers. On Debian based systems you get those
with the `libsnmp-dev` package.

## Usage

There's nothing special about using this. Start the binary from your
CMake build folder.
